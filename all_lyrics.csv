A Bar Song (Tipsy),Shaboozey,2024,human,"My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasolines and groceries, the list goes on and on
This 9 to 5 ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four

Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more

Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor

Oh my, good Lord



Can someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey?

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history

Therе's a party downtown, near 5th Street

Everybody at the bar gеttin' tipsy

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy



I been Boozey since I left, I ain't changin' for shit

Tell my ma', I ain't forget (Oh, Lord, uh)

Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again

Tell your girl to bring a friend (Oh, Lord)



One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four

Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more

Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor

Oh my, good Lord



Can someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey? (A double shot of whiskey)

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history (We go way back)

There's a party downtown, near 5th Street

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo)

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy



One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four

When it's last call and they kick us out the door

It's gettin' kind of late but the ladies want some more

Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drink some more)



Can someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey? (A double shot of whiskey)

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history (Way back)

There's a party downtown, near 5th Street (Come on)

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo)

Can someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history (History)

At the bottom of a bottle gon' miss me (Bet you gon' miss me)

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy



That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar"
Beautiful Things,Benson Boone,2024,human,"For a while there it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all

And I thank God every day

For the girl he sent my way

But I know the things he gives me, he can take away

And I hold you every night

And that's a feeling I wanna get used to

But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you



Oh, I hope I don't lose you

Mm

Please stay

I want you, I need you, oh God

Don't take

These beautiful things that I've got



Please stay

I want you, I need you, oh God

Don't take

These beautiful things that I've got



Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, please

Please don't take



I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane

It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith

If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?

Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough

I've got peace and I've got love

But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all



Please stay

I want you, I need you, oh God

Don't take

These beautiful things that I've got



Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, please



Please stay

I want you, I need you, oh God

I need

These beautiful things that I've got"
I Had Some Help,Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen,2024,human,"You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?

Livin' in your big glass house with a view

I thought you knew



I had some help

It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself

Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell

They say, ""Teamwork makes the dream work""

Hell, I had some help (Help)



(Help)



You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumblin'

Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'

Already lost the game that you been runnin'

Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh

You think that you're so innocent

After all the shit you did

I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent

Can't wash our hands of this



I had some help

It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself

Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell

They say, ""Teamwork makes the dream work""

Hell, I had some help (Help)



(Help)

(Help)

(Help)



It takes two to break a heart in two, ooh

Baby, you blame me and, baby, I blame you

Aw, if that ain't the truth (Oh)



I had some help

It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself

Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""

Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo

What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?

The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama

How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options

I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton

Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'

Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas

Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em

Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him

Pole on him, extort shit, bully, Death Row on him

Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young

You better not ever go to cell block one

To any bitch that talk to him and they in love

Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him

They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs

And Party at the party playin' with his nose now

And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?

Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles

Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up

Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff

Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?

Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor



They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us



You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?

I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga

Did Cole fouI, I don't know why you still pretendin'

What is the owl? Bird niggas and bird bitches, go

The audience not dumb

Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow

Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise

Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted

Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'

Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'

You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers

What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy

Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton

Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star, ""Quit hidin'""

Fuck a caption, want action, no accident

And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished

Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'

Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'

I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither

From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena

And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks

That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch

I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'

Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy

Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy

How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy

One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy

Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy

Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy

City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy



They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us



Once upon a time, all of us was in chains

Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves

Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains

Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game

The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer

Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda

You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance

Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge

You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)

Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)

21 gave you false street cred

Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)

Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)

2 Chainz say you good, but he lied

You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars

No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer

The family matter and the truth of the matter

It was God's plan to show y'all the liar



Mm

Mm-mm

He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)

Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God

I Remember Everything,Zach Bryan featuring Kacey Musgraves,2024,human,"Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach town rests on the drying line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hanging out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowing in my eyes

Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry



Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?

I'd sing you my love songs, and you'd tell me about

How your momma ran off and pawned her ring

I remember, I remember everything



A cold shoulder at closing time, you were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose

Strange words come on out of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke

Pictures and passing time, you only smile like that when you're drinking

I wish I didn't, but I do remember every moment on the nights with you



You're drinking everything to ease your mind

But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?

You're like concrete feet in the summer heat

That burns like hell when two souls meet

No, you'll never be the man that you always swore

But I'll remember you singing in that '88 Ford



A cold shoulder at closing time, you were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose

Strange words come on out of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke

Pictures and passing time, you only smile like that when you're drinking

To go to bed before the daylight

Dark as a lake

Smelling like a bonfire

Lost in a haze?

But who wants to live forever, babe

You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate

The rest of you like you're the TSA

I wish that I could go along

Babe, don't get me wrong



You know you're bright as the morning

As soft as the rain

Pretty as a vine

As sweet as a grape

If you can sit in a barrel

Maybe I'll wait

Until that day

Stick Season,Noah Kahan,2024,human,"As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must have had yourself a change of heart halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on driving straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face

And memories are something even smoking weed does not replace

And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains

And doc told me to travel but there's COVID on the planes



And I, love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks

And I, saw your mom, she forgot that I existed

And it's, half my fault but I just like to play the victim

I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas

And I'll, dream each night of some version of you

That I, might not have but I did not lose

Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes

And I'm split in half but that'll have to do



So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad

That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad

No and I'm no longer funny but I miss the way you laugh

You once called me forever now you still can't call me back

I hope this pain's just passing through

But I doubt it

See, my old man's got a problem

He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is

He said his body's too old for working

His body's too young to look like his

She wanted more from life than he could give

I said, somebody's got to take care of him

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

We go cruising to entertain ourselves

You still ain't got a job

So I work in the market as a checkout girl

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

I got a job that pays all our bills

You stay out drinking late at the bar

See more of your friends than you do of your kids

I'd always hoped for better

Thought maybe together you and me would find it

I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere

Take your fast car and keep on driving

Lying with me

Let me hold you now

Let me slow it down



Ain't it funny how it changes

How the future rearranges?

Maybe loving you is dangerous

I could lose you like the others

Only girl that's never left me is my mother

All I Want for Christmas Is You,Mariah Carey,2024,human,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true... 

All I want for Christmas 

Is you... 



I don't want a lot for Christmas 

There is just one thing I need 

I don't care about presents 

Underneath the Christmas tree 

I don't need to hang my stocking 

There upon the fireplace 

Santa Claus won't make me happy 

With a toy on Christmas day 

I just want you for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

All I want for Christmas is you... 

You baby 



I won't ask for much this Christmas 

I won't even wish for snow 

I'm just gonna keep on waiting 

Underneath the mistletoe 

I won't make a list and send it 

To the North Pole for Saint Nick 

I won't even stay awake to 

Hear those magic reindeer click 

'Cause I just want you here tonight 

Holding on to me so tight 

What more can I do 

Baby all I want for Christmas is you 

You... 



All the lights are shining 

So brightly everywhere 

And the sound of children's 

Laughter fills the air 

And everyone is singing 

I hear those sleigh bells ringing 

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need - 

won't you please bring my baby to me... 



Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas 

This is all I'm asking for 

I just want to see my baby 

Standing right outside my door 

Oh I just want him for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

Baby all I want for Christmas is 

You... 



All I want for Christmas is you baby... all I want for Chrismas is you baby...."

Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise

I loved you truly

As you sunk your teeth into me, oh

Bloodsucker, famefucker

Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire



And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news

You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too

You're so convincing

How do you lie without flinching?

(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)

Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill

Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will

Went for me and not her

You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?

You can't love anyone 'cause that could mean you had a heart

I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't

It's like she knows I'm lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leaning on old memories
And talking 'bout what used to be

She'll probably be the death of me

But damn if it ain't sweet



She's my pretty little poison

My heartache in the night

With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide

Yeah she came with a warnin'

But I didn't mind

I'll go out on that high every time

She's my pretty little poison

My pretty little poison



Shadows dancin' down the hall

Whispers that she wants me

Try my best not to fall

When she falls into me

We all need some kind of fix

For me she's the one I pick

Nothin' else will do the trick

She's all I need



She's my pretty little poison

My heartache in the night

With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide

Lot of niggas debatin' my numeral
Not the three, not the two, I'm the U-N-O

Yeah

Numero U-N-O

Me and Drizzy, this shit like the Super Bowl

Man, this shit damn near big as the—



Big as the what? Big as the what? Big as the what?

Big as the Super Bowl

But the difference is it's just two guys playin' shit that they did in the studio

Niggas usually send they verses back to me and they be terrible, just like a two-year old

I love a dinner with some fine women

When they start debatin' about who the G.O.A.T

I'm like ""Go 'head, say it then, who the G.O.A.T.?

Can't trust everything that you saw on IG

Just know if I diss you, I'd make sure you know that I hit you like I'm on your caller ID

I'm namin' the album The Fall Off, it's pretty ironic 'cause it ain't no fall off for me

Still in this bitch gettin' bigger, they waitin' on the kid to come drop like a father to be

Love when they argue the hardest MC

Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?

We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammed Ali

The one that they call when they shit ain't connectin' no more, feel like I got a job in IT

Rhymin' with me is the biggest mistake

Hate how the gang gotta wait for the boss, man, this shit like a prison escape

Everybody steppers, well fuck it, then everybody breakfast and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh, huh, huh)

The G.O.A.T. with the golden pin, the top toucher

She got a Android, her messages is lime green

I search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings

Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine

Man, I pack 'em in this phone like some sardines

And they send me naked pictures, it's the small things

You niggas is still takin' pictures on a dog stream

My youngers richer than you rappers and they all stream

I really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams

Man, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing

Will they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not

They don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot

They know The Boy the one they gotta boycott

I told Jim and Jammer I use a GRAMMY as a door stop

Girl gave me some head because I need it

And if I fuck with you, then after I might eat it, wait

I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle

Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale

A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now

You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted

Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection

Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one

Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from

V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one

Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk



Remember?

Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?

Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch

I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous

Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with

I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress

Surprised you wanted that feature request

You know that we got some shit to address

I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess

Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess

Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed

Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat

I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet

Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? Bet

When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches

I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em

Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya

You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga

Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?

Ho, what? You ain't like that record?

""Back To Back,"" I like that record

I'ma get back to that, for the record

Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?

That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that

Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that

Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that

Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that

Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that

Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that

Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you

Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too

Tell BEAM that he better stay right with you

Am I battlin' ghost or AI? Nigga feelin' like Joel Osteen

Funny, he was in a film called ""AI""

And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him

I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin

Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders

Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence

What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast

And I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it

Pick a nigga off one at a time with it

We can be on a three-hour time difference

Don't speak on the family, crodie

It can get deep in the family, crodie

Talk about me and my family, crodie?

Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie

I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie

Tell me you're cheesin', fam

We can do this right now on the camera, crodie

Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas

I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm

Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food

Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too

If you take it there, I'm takin' it further

Psst, that's somethin' you don't wanna do



Ooh

We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more

Where the Wild Things Are,Luke Combs,2024,human,"My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kicked-started that bike one night and broke Mama's heart
He pointed that headlight west

Out where the wild things are



He'd call me up every couple of weeks

From South California

Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree

And his pretty girl stories

How he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar

Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here

Out where the wild things are""



Oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams

Oh, the nights ignite like gasoline

And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark

Out where the wild things are



I called my brother from the back of that plane

The second I made it

We started drinkin' on the strip in LA

And then it got crazy

Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars

Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool

Out where the wild things are



Oh, yeah

Couple iron horse rebels

Wild as the devil

I knew I had to move back east

Said goodbye to my brother

At the end of that summer

But I knew he'd never leave



Oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams

Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline

And oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed

And oh, they said he hit that guardrail at half past three

Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark

We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars

Out where the wild things are

I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy

I keep my distance

But you still catch my eye

Tell me baby

Do you recognize me?

Well

It's been a year

It doesn't surprise me

I wrapped it up and sent it

With a note saying ""I love you""

I meant it

Now I know what a fool I've been

But if you kissed me now

I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room

Friends with tired eyes

I'm hiding from you

And your soul of ice

My god I thought you were

Someone to rely on

Me?

I guess I was a shoulder to cry on



A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

A man under cover but you tore me apart

Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

A man under cover buy you tore him apart

Maybe next year I'll give it to someone

I'll give it to someone special."

We make up and we break up and they swear they'll never call me

But I still keep their number and their necklace

Kisses to my exes



Happens every timе

I don't mean, mean to be cold but it's how I gеt, uh-uh

Me and all my pride

Tryna burn down every damn bridge any time we can

And again



I'm a, I'm a, I'm a wild heart that never stops

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a hard case they can't unlock

And I, and I swear I care a lot, just not enough

Let's just say, it is what it is and was what it was

We make up and we break up and they swear they'll never call me

But I still keep their number and their necklace

Kisses to my exes



Oh, I'm sorry, sorry that you love me (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Change my mind up like it's origami

Oh, I'm sorry, sorry that you love me (Ah-ah-ah)

Change my mind up like it's ori—



Say, say, I wanna go there then I wanna leave

Make another promise that I can't keep

I don't ever know what I want but that's what you want

If you're down with it, don't blame me (Me)

Breakin' it all before it starts (Starts)

Makin' it all up in my head

But I just overshare 'bout things I never meant



I'm a, I'm a, I'm a wild heart that never stops

Change my mind up like it's origami

Oh, I'm sorry, sorry that you love me (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Kisses to my exes, I know that I did you dirty

Little messed up, little selfish the way I married out in thirty

Yeah, we hooked up then we broke up, then I said you really hurt me

But I still got your number and your necklace

Kisses to my exes"
A Holly Jolly Christmas,Burl Ives,2024,human,"Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year 
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly, jolly Christmas

And when you walk down the street 

Say hello to friends you know 

And everyone you meet



Oh

Ho

The mistletoe 

Hung where you can see



Somebody waits for you

Kiss her once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas

And in case you didn't hear



Oh by golly

Have a holly

Jolly Christmas this year



Have a holly, jolly Christmas

It's the best time of the year 



Have a holly, jolly Christmas

Wind Up Missin' You,Tucker Wetmore,2024,human,"I know I might look like
Another ball cap on a barstool
Underneath a PBR light
Saying everything under the moon
To get you into my arms tonight
You probably heard it all a thousand times

But it ain't what it looks like

Girl, let me tell you what it looks like



You look like waves on a sunset

And you can crash on me all night

You look like wine in a truck bed

A little what I'm doing for the rest of my life 'cause

You look like I'm done looking

But, girl, the hard truth is

If this night don't turn into two

You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you



I got to tell you, baby, I've been

The kind of boy your daddy never wanted you to go and fall in love with

The kind of boys you're probably done with their dumb shit, yeah

I bet you've heard the stories and

Can't I say I'm proud of that but

I've turned the page on the old me

And now I ain't lookin' back 'cause



You look like waves on a sunset

And you can crash on me all night

You look like wine in a truck bed

A little what I'm doing for the rest of my life 'cause

You look like I'm done looking

But, girl, the hard truth is

If this night don't turn into two

You look like I'm gonna wind up missin'



Missin' you in the mornin'

And probably for the next few years

And when I look back on it

I'll still see you right here



You look like waves on a sunset

And you can crash on me all night

You look like wine in a truck bed

A little what I'm doing for the rest of my life 'cause

You look like I'm done looking

But, girl, the hard truth is

If this night don't turn into two

You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you



Wind up missin' you

Wind up missin' you"
Bulletproof,Nate Smith,2024,human,"Usually these ol' neon lights
Are pretty good for bad goodbyes
They got some girls off of my mind
But baby, not tonight
'Cause I've been putting in overtime

Trying to get over your leaving

You're still right here on my mind

You sure did a number on me



I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim

I've tried every last one of them

Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf

But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help

Been taking these shots, shots, shots

80, 90, everything they've got

But the whiskey don't kill like it's supposed to do

Baby, your memory must be bulletproof



There ain't no way I'm driving home

I'm three sheets, done tied one on

But this liquor ain't as strong

As your sweet love is



I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim

I've tried every last one of them

Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf

But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help

Been taking these shots, shots, shots

80, 90, everything they've got

But the whiskey don't kill like it's supposed to do

Baby, your memory must be bulletproof



All my favorite country songs

Guess they must've got it wrong

'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone

You ain't gone, baby



I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim

I've tried every last one of them

Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf

But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help

Been taking these shots, shots, shots

80, 90, everything they've got

But the whiskey don't kill like it's supposed to do

Baby, your memory must be bulletproof



All my favorite country songs

Guess they must've got it wrong

'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone

You ain't gone, baby

You ain't gone, baby



Baby, your memory must be bulletproof"
The Painter,Cody Johnson,2024,human,"She talks about the future like she's flippin' through a magazine
Finds the beauty in the thrown away and broken things
Gets excited about all my crazy dreams
Got every sunset that she's ever seen memorized
Saves them away for a rainy day or stormy night

The sky is brighter lookin' at it through her eyes



I don't remember

Life before she came into the picture

Brought the beauty I was missin' with her

Showed me colors I ain't ever seen

She took chances

With every wall I built, she saw a canvas

I thank God every day for how He made her

My life was black and white, but she's the painter



She reminds me that it ain't too late to start again

Fine is good, but you need some blue every now and then

How'd I live so long without her reckless touch?



I don't remember

Life before she came into the picture

Brought the beauty I was missin' with her

Showed me colors I ain't ever seen

She took chances

With every wall I built, she saw a canvas

I thank God every day for how He made her

My life was black and white, but she's the painter

Down Bad,Taylor Swift,2024,human,"Did you really beam me up?
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on
Tell me I was the chosen one
Show me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

For a moment, I knew cosmic love



Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym

Everything comes out teenage petulance

""Fuck it if I can't have him""

""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Down bad, waking up in blood

Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up

Fuck it if I can't have us

I might just not get up

I might stay down bad



Fuck it if I can't have him

Down bad

Fuck it if I can't have him



Did you take all my old clothes?

Just to leave me here naked and alone

In a field in my same old town

That somehow seems so hollow now

They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about the existence of you

For a moment, I was heaven struck



Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym (Crying at the gym)

Everything comes out teenage petulance

""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)

""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Down bad, waking up in blood (Waking up in blood)

Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up

Fuck it if I can't have us

I might just not get up

I might stay down bad



Like I lost my twin

Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)

Down bad

Waving at the ship

Fuck it if I can't have him



I loved your hostile takeovers

Encounters closer and closer

All your indecent exposures

How dare you say that it's-

I'll build you a fort on some planet

Where they can all understand it

How dare you think it's romantic

Leaving me safe and stranded

'Cause fuck it, I was in love

So fuck you if I can't have us

'Cause fuck it, I was in love



Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym (Crying at the gym)

Everything comes out teenage petulance

""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)

""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Down bad, waking up in blood (Waking up in blood)

Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up

Fuck it if I can't have us

I might just not get up

I might stay down bad



Like I lost my twin

Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)

Down bad

Waving at the ship

Fuck it if I can't have him



Like I lost my twin

Fuck it if I can't have him

Down bad

Waving at the ship

Fuck it if I can't have him"
Dance the Night,Dua Lipa,2024,human,"Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Ooh, my outfit so tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight

I can take the heat, baby, best believe

That's the moment I shine



'Cause every romance shakes and it bends

Don't give a damn

When the night's here, I don't do tears

Baby, no chance



I could dance, I could dance, I could dance



Watch me dance, dance the night away

My hеart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face

Watch me dancе, dance the night away (Uh-huh)

I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place



Lately, I been movin' close to the edge

Still be lookin' my best

I stay on the beat, you can count on me

I ain't missin' no steps



'Cause every romance shakes and it bends

Don't give a damn

When the night's here, I don't do tears

Baby, no chance



I could dance, I could dance, I could dance



Watch me dance, dance the night away

My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face

Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)

I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place



When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)

When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)

I don't play safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance



Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face

I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)

Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face (Yes, I can, yes, I can)

I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place



Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)

My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face

Watch me dance (Dance), dance the night away (Uh-huh)

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance



Dance the night"
