Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie

I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours

Say things you don't understand

I can take myself dancing

And I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can



Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby



Paint my nails cherry red

Match the roses that you left

No remorse, no regret

I forget every word you said



Ooh, I didn't wanna leave, baby, I didn't wanna fight

Nah, nah, just want you

If I can't have you, no one should



I might, I might kill my ex, not the best idea

His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?

I might kill my ex, I still love him though

Rather be in jail than alone



I get the sense that it's a lost cause

I get the sense that you might really love her

This text gon' be evidence

The text is evidence

I try to ration with you no morals or crimes of passion, but damn

You was out of reach

You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach

Now I'm in the basement, plan a home invasion

Fast Car,Luke Combs,2023,human,"You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose

Maybe we'll make something

Me, myself, I got nothing to prove



You got a fast car

And I got a plan to get us out of here

I've been working at the convenience store

Managed to save just a little bit of money

Won't have to drive too far

Just across the border and into the city

And you and I can both get jobs

Finally see what it means to be living



See, my old man's got a problem

He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is

He said his body's too old for working

His body's too young to look like his

So Mama went off and left him

She wanted more from life than he could give

I said, somebody's got to take care of him

So I quit school and that's what I did



You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Still gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

We go cruising to entertain ourselves

You still ain't got a job

So I work in the market as a checkout girl

I know things will get better

You'll find work and I'll get promoted

And we'll move out of the shelter

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

I got a job that pays all our bills

You stay out drinking late at the bar

See more of your friends than you do of your kids

I'd always hoped for better

Thought maybe together you and me would find it

I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere

Take your fast car and keep on driving



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Still gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way"

Cruel Summer,Taylor Swift,2023,human,"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

""I love you,"" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice

Know some people that's still unemployed

I know a felon who tryna get FOID

Child support your only support

For a visit, I'm goin' through courts

Went to jail, they was chainin' me up

First-generation ghetto nigga

Cole world, hello niggas

Made it out the city with my head on straight

Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out

Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out

And the shit that I spit out

Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO

And how a nigga put a hit out

And another one, and, and another one

I got like a hundred of 'em

'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me

But I'm really in front of them

Now some of them fumblin' they bags

Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had

A reminder to humble yourself

This shit could be gone in an instant

Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'

I been stuck between maybe retirin'

And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime

These days seein' rappers be dyin'

Way before they even gettin' they shine

I never even heard of lil' buddy

'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy

Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name

Got to playin' his tunes

All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn

This shit wicked, to get they name buzzin'

Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""

And media thirsty for clicks

I got a new rule

If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive

You can't post about him after he get hit

It's simple, it's the principle

On any tempo, I'm invincible

Don't even rap, I just vent to you

I rather that than an interview most days

Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase

Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage

I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid

And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

Love You Anyway,Luke Combs,2023,human,"If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in Ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I'd be in pieces trying to make the breaking last
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes



There's just some things that leave a man no choice

Like a compass needle needing its true north

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Oh, I'd love you anyway



I know just tryin' to write a song

I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong

And well I guess what I'm tryin' to say

Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away

Not a thing about the way I feel would change



There's just some things that leave a man no choice

Like a compass needle needing its true north

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Oh, I'd love you anyway

I got a lot of habits I gotta kick

But weigh out all your options and take your pick



I can either burn the bar down

Or I can take your number out my phone

I can give you up right now

And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned

If you want me to quit you, want me to get you

Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind

I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time



I know I got me some problems

About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt

But if I'm gonna solve 'em

Baby, I'lI take all thе help I can get



If you ain't gonna kiss me

Nicotine amphetamines too

A hundred grand large when I shop, that's the total

Fill up the garage, bitch, I'm a mogul

Drop top Royce, I'm going crazy

La Bebé,Yng Lvcas and Peso Pluma,2023,human,"Hoy es noche de estar soltera
Le gusta el perreo y bailar de cerca
Me encanta cuando bellaquea
Quiere que la toque, pe-ro sabes ti
Que esta noche estás pa' mí
Ven, trépate encima 'e mí, manda la ubi', paso por ti

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

No se le ha olvidado cómo la pasamos

Fuimos a la disco y los dos bailamos pegados

Como perros pegaos, besos y par de tragos

Se quedó a mi lado y dijo: ""creo me he enamorado""

Ella fuma, ella toma

Es diablita, chiquita, pero picosa

Me encanta cuando el pantalón me lo rosa

A ella le encanta, se ve en su cara lo goza

Tiene novio y no se comporta

Me dice: ""tranqui, que la relación 'ta rota""

Nuestros cuerpos chocan y chocan

Se juntan las bocas, los leggings le ahorcan

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Bebimos un par de botellas

Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer, ayer, ayer

Y te movias muy bien, muy bien

Y se impregnó el olor de Chanel

Tamos 1000 grados farenheit

Está buena y de cara bonita

Le pones música y solita se excita

Pa' la fiesta nunca se limita

Par de amigas, completa la cuadrilla

Pero tú, mamá, sabes, me mamas

Loca, ven pa'cá, pégate hasta atrás

Nos vamos tú y yo en un viaje fugaz

Interestellar, comerte toda

Fumaremos los dos marihuana

En el cuarto, en la azotea y en mi cama

Nena, creo te llaman, contesta mañana

Que no se apague la flama

Llama a los bomberos, que el cuarto se va a incendiar

De tanto calor creo que nos vamos a desmayar

Chica, ven pa'cá, que te voy a bellaquear

Ojitos chinitos como dice Don Omar

La bebé, la bebé

Y hasta abajo la bebé

Hasta abajo la bebé

Hasta abajo la bebé

Hasta abajo la bebé-bé-bé-bé

Quiere que le ponga música

Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

Golden Hour,Jvke,2023,human,"It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi, I was all alone



With the love of my life

She's got glitter for skin

My radiant beam in the night

I don't need no light to see you



Shine

It's your golden hour

You slow down time

In your golden hour



We were just two lovers

Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer

Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power

Minutes feel like hours

She knew she was the baddest

Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?



For the love of my life

She's got glow on her face

A glorious look in her eyes

My angel of light



I was all alone with the love of my life

She's got glitter for skin

My radiant beam in the night

I don't need no light to see you

No more chance to you

There's a U-Haul trailer

Next thing you know

There goes the carpet

But the deer head stays

Spend it all at a jewelry store, gettin'

Down on one knee on her mama's porch

Just prayin' she don't say no

Your best man gives a half-drunk speech and you're

Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and you're

Left hand's gettin' used to that ring

Next thing you know

There's a test on the counter

Next thing you know

She's standin' there cryin'

Noddin' her head yes

You're half excited

Half scared to death



'Cause next thing you know

You're wearing scrubs and a funny white hat and the

Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and

Nobody's ever called you that

And you take that drive home slow

Next thing you know

It's first steps, first dates, first car, it's

11:01 wonderin' where they are

You're sayin' that USC's too far

It's amazing how fast 17 years go

Next thing you know

Next thing you know



Next thing you know

You get to know your wife again and you're

More in love than you've ever been with a

Lot of years of remember when's

And still some down the road

Take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish, and ya

Tell 'em stories every chance you get

I ordered two more wines, 'cause tonight I want him

I find myself in this shit position

The man that I love sat me down last night

And he told me that it's over, dumb decision

And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'

Fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'

And I'm out on the town with a simple mission

In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'



Just a heart broke bitch

High heels six inch

In the back of the nightclub, sipping champagne

I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with

In the back of the taxi sniffing cocaine

Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex

I was looking for a man who's on the same page

To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

Back to my ways like 2019

Not 24 hours since my ex did dead it

I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty

Last night really was the cherry on the cake

Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'

Excuse my state

I'm as high as your hopes that you'll make it on my bed

Get me hot and sizzlin'

If I take a step back to see the glass half full

At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in

And I'm already actin' like a dick

Know what I mean?

So you might as well stick it in

I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah

Out of reach, out of touch, too numb, I don't feel no way

Toast up, so what, street small but it go both ways

So, you'll run, but you'll never escape

Sunset in the maze

Wait in the Truck,Hardy featuring Lainey Wilson,2023,human,"I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Working my way through a middle-of-June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was something in the headlights
It stopped me on a dime

Well, she was scared to death, so I said

""Climb in, "" and then she climbed

Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe

With a tear in her blood-stained shirt

She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to

I knew what had happened to her

I didn't load her down with questions

That girl had been through enough

I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes

And I asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

When he said to me

""Wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came

So I kicked in his double-wide door

I let the hammer drop before he got

To that 12 he was reaching for

I didn't try to hide my pistol

I didn't even try to run

I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes

And waited for the cops to come

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

""Wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck""

Whoa (whoa)

Have mercy on me, Lord

Have mercy on me

Have mercy on me (hey), Lord

It's been 60 months and she still comes

To see me from time to time

It was worth the price, to see a brighter side

Of the girl I picked up that night

And I might be here forever

It ain't paradise, that's true

But it's whole hell of a lot better

Than the place I sent him to, yeah

Wait in the truck (have mercy on me)

Just wait in the truck

(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)

Wait in the truck (Lord, have mercy)

Just wait in the truck

Then it's only me that’s in this room

I guess I could just pretend

The colours are more than blue

But I lost more than my friend

I can't help but missing you



I pictured this month a little bit different no one is ever ready

And when it unfolds you get in a hole

Everything changes, nothing’s the same

Except the truth is now you’re gone

And life just goes on

Que hasta la vida me mejoró

Por acá ya no eres bienvenido

Vi lo que tu novia me tiró

Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río



No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi Norte

Haciendo dinero como deporte

Llenando la cuenta, los shows, el parking y el pasaporte

Estoy más dura, dicen los reportes



Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí

Espérame ahí, que yo soy idiota

Se te olvidó que estoy en otra

Y que te quedó grande la Bichota

How your momma ran off and pawned her ring

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'll die for you



I'm untethering from the parts of me you recognize

From charming to alarming in seconds

I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize

But that's morning, I'll forget it

But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy

I keep my distance

But you still catch my eye

Tell me baby

Do you recognize me?

Well

It's been a year

It doesn't surprise me

I wrapped it up and sent it

With a note saying ""I love you""

I meant it

Now I know what a fool I've been

But if you kissed me now

I know you'd fool me again



[CHORUS]



A crowded room

Friends with tired eyes

I'm hiding from you

And your soul of ice

My god I thought you were

Someone to rely on

Me?

I guess I was a shoulder to cry on



A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

A man under cover but you tore me apart

Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

A man under cover buy you tore him apart

Maybe next year I'll give it to someone

I'll give it to someone special."

The lamp on the nightstand

One that says don't cuss and don't fight

Or let the bottle turn you into a different man

Those get you into Heaven letters in red

Ain't gettin' read enough to

Keep me on a straight line

I'm a Jack of all trades

But man I gotta say

That's one book I didn't write



I met a good girl

She had her life straight

She said she loved that I was good at everythin'

One day she left me in a cloud of dust

'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up



The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand

The one that says don't cuss and don't fight

Yeah the good Lord knows I need it

I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it

Watermelon Moonshine,Lainey Wilson,2023,human,"It was right after senior year
Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets

We gave each other more than our hearts

With the help of a mason jar



Drinkin' watermelon moonshine

Cut the burn with a little lime

Parkin' back in them kudzu vines

I was his and every bit of that boy was minе

Too young to know what love was

But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz

There's never nothin' like the first time

And mine's always gonna taste like

Watermelon moonshine



I don't remember where we got it from

I just remember feelin' all grown up

Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing

Never told him it was my first drink

But I told him that he was the one

You're so sure when you're that young

You think you got it all figured out

And now I laugh when I think about



Drinkin' watermelon moonshine

Cut the burn with a little lime

Parkin' back in them kudzu vines

I was his and every bit of that boy was mine

Too young to know what love was

But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz

There's never nothin' like the first time

And mine's always gonna taste like

Watermelon moonshine



I thought that high would last forever

But that ain't what it does

Maybe we were drunk in love

Or maybe we were just



Drinkin' watermelon moonshine

Cut the burn with a little lime

Parkin' back in them kudzu vines

I was his and every bit of that boy was mine

Too young to know what love was

But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz

When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways

You can't deny how hard I've tried

I changed who I was to put you both first

For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground

When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

But once you turn, they hate us



Oh, the misery

Everybody wants to be my enemy

Spare the sympathy

Being a wreck of emotions

Ready to go whenever just let me know

The enemy’s on my trail, my energy unavailable

I’ma tell ’em, “Hasta luego”

They wanna plot on my trot to the top

I’ve been outta shape, thinkin’ out the box

I’m an astronaut

I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe

And it matters more because I had it not

Had I thought about wreaking havoc

On an opposition, kinda shockin’

They wanted static with precision

I’m automatic quarterback

I ain’t talkin’ sacking, pack it

Pack it up, I don’t panic, batter-batter up

Who the baddest?

It don’t matter ’cause we at ya throat

I could be the CEO, just a like a Robyn Fenty

And for no reasons they wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls

We don't talk about Bruno, but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready

And there wasn't a cloud in the sky

No clouds allowed in the sky

Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin

Thunder

You telling this story or am I?

I'm sorry, mi vida, go on

Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""

Why did he tell us?

In doing so, he floods my brain

Abuela, get the umbrellas

Married in a hurricane

What a joyous day but anyway



We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no

We don't talk about Bruno



Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling

I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling

I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch ch ch

It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling

Always left Abuela and the family fumbling

Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand

Do you understand?

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back

When he calls your name it all fades to black

Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Hey)



We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no

We don't talk about Bruno



He told me my fish would die, the next day, dead (No, no)

He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said (No, no)

He said that all my hair would disappear, now, look at my head (No, no)

Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read



He told me that the life of my dreams

Would be promised, and someday be mine

He told me that my power would grow

Like the grapes that thrive on the vine (Óye, Mariano's on his way)

He told me that the man of my dreams

Would be just out of reach

Betrothed to another

It's like I hear him, now

Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you

It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him, now



Um, Bruno

Yeah, about that Bruno

I really need to know about Bruno

Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno (Isabela, your boyfriend's here)

Time for dinner

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back (It was my wedding day, it was our wedding day )

When he calls your name it all fades to black (We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)

Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin)

Not a word about Bruno

I never shoulda brought up Bruno"

Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'

In a Minute,Lil Baby,2022,human,"Damn Kai, you goin' crazy
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?

Still runnin' 'round with mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard

People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet

Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet

Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time

Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em

Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""

We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided

Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence

I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it

She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her

Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league

I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?

Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's

Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe

Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy

Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly

Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta

I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo

Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo

Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so

This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh

Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""

C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco

AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco



I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal



Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation

Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location

Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation

Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation

Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at

Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at

Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach

Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”

You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back

Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""

Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at

Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that

Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that

Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back

Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at



I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong

So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city

You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from

And I admit it, I still got empathy

And you gon' feel it for two weeks

When I release you in them streets

And keep my meaning discrete

Keep the clean in my Jeep

And put that Yeezy in your teeth

Let my bitches off they leashes

If you even think to speak

I'ma give a whole new meaning

When you said you live in a dream

We can keep that shit asleep

And you gon' laugh with all your Gs

Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep

Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R-I-P

Buy Dirt,Jordan Davis and Luke Bryan,2022,human,"Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said, what you been up to lately
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out

Said if you want my two cents on making a dollar count



Buy dirt

Find the one you can’t live without

Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground

Do what you love but call it work

And throw a little money in the plate at church

Send some prayers up and your roots down deep

Add a few limbs to your family tree

And watch their pencils marks

And the grass in the yard

All grow up

‘Cause the truth about it is

It all goes by real quick

You can’t buy happiness

But you can buy dirt



Before you get caught on that ladder

Let me tell you what it’s all about

Find you a few things that matter

That you can put a fence around

And then he laid it out



Buy dirt

Find the one you can’t live without

Get ring, let your knee hit the ground

Do what you love but call it work

And throw a little money in the plate at church

Send some prayers up and your roots down deep

And add a few limbs to your family tree

And watch their pencils marks

And the grass in the yard

All grow up

‘Cause the truth about it is

It all goes by real quick

You can’t buy happiness

But you can buy dirt



You can buy dirt



And thank the good Lord for it

‘Cause He ain’t makin’ any more of it



Buy dirt

Find the one you can’t live without

Get ring, let your knee hit the ground

Do what you love but call it work

And throw a little money in the plate at church

Send some prayers up and your roots down deep

Add a few limbs to your family tree

Watch their pencils marks

And the grass in the yard

All grow up

‘Cause the truth about it is

It all goes by real quick

You can’t buy happiness

But you can buy dirt"

I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
I move mountains
I move churches

And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is



I don't ask how hard the work is

Got a rough, indestructible surface

Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em

I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but



Under the surface

I feel berserk as a tightrope walking in a three-ring circus

Under the surface

Was Hercules ever like “Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?”



Under the surface

I'm pretty surе I'm worthless is I can't be of servicе

A flaw or a crack

The straw in the stack

That breaks the camel's back

What breaks the camel's back?



It's pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop, whoa

Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-uh-uh

Give it to your sister, your sister's older

Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder

Who am I if I can't run with the ball?

If I fall to



Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa

Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-uh-uh

Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger

See if she can hang on a little longer

Who am I if I can't carry it all?

Bring you back to your senses

Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye



I heard you found yourself a brand new man

Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance

Built a house right by the coast

That ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know

He don't know you like I did

Money talks, but I ain't buyin'



'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger

And I thought to ask her how she's been

Said she's missin' ya and tried to go convincin' ya

Not to settle down with him

She ain't wrong, the whole town knows it

You had a bed of roses, but girl, you couldn't walk that line

You can act like you're doin' fine

All I Want for Christmas Is You,Mariah Carey,2022,human,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true... 

All I want for Christmas 

Is you... 



I don't want a lot for Christmas 

There is just one thing I need 

I don't care about presents 

Underneath the Christmas tree 

I don't need to hang my stocking 

There upon the fireplace 

Santa Claus won't make me happy 

With a toy on Christmas day 

I just want you for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

All I want for Christmas is you... 

You baby 



I won't ask for much this Christmas 

I won't even wish for snow 

I'm just gonna keep on waiting 

Underneath the mistletoe 

I won't make a list and send it 

To the North Pole for Saint Nick 

I won't even stay awake to 

Hear those magic reindeer click 

'Cause I just want you here tonight 

Holding on to me so tight 

What more can I do 

Baby all I want for Christmas is you 

You... 



All the lights are shining 

So brightly everywhere 

And the sound of children's 

Laughter fills the air 

And everyone is singing 

I hear those sleigh bells ringing 

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need - 

won't you please bring my baby to me... 



Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas 

This is all I'm asking for 

I just want to see my baby 

Standing right outside my door 

Oh I just want him for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

Baby all I want for Christmas is 

You... 



All I want for Christmas is you baby... all I want for Chrismas is you baby...."

Red wine and mistakes

Tears rollin' down your face

Throwin' in the towel takes some effort

So I’d rather ride it out for better weather

Together

Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due

With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool



I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand

Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band

Singin' them same damn songs like I am now

I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage

Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins

At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town

I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this



I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day

Who was burnin' CDs just to give away

Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this



Five deep in a van, head full of steam

Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true

Livin' this life just like I was born to do



I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand

It ain't about the fortune

It ain't about the name

It ain't about the glory

And thinkin' 'bout her past make her lash out

Said we'd always put each other first

Old love songs we used to play to

Now I remember when you'd call me late at night

I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you

And all your daddy issues

But now I don't even miss you anymore



So I, I want all the tears back that I cried

All the hours spent giving advice

On how to write your songs

All you did was prove me wrong

When you said you loved me

Well, you must've had your fingers crossed



Shoulda paid attention to my friends

Telling me how bad it's gonna end

Always giving their opinions

Now I wish I would have listened



I could say I'm sorry but I'm not

And that magic's not here no more

And I might be okay

But I'm not fine at all



'Cause there we are again, on that little town street

You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me

Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well



Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed

Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team

You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me



And I know it's long gone

And there's nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough

To forget why I needed to



'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night

We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all to well



And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much

But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up

Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well



And you call me up again just to break me like a promise

So casually cruel in the name of being honest

I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here

'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well



Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own

Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone



But you keep my old scarf from that very first week

'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah



'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well



Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all

Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all

It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"

She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know
I met her down at Aldean's

She said she that saw me walkin' in about a mile away

Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away

She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance

I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance

I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down

I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found

Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around



Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out

They don't love you and they only love you right now

If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home

And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)

Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)

Leave them Broadway girls alone



They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""

Broadway girls a trap

They on me, they tryna finesse me

They see me with Morgan and know that I rap

My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on

I jump on a horse, she get on the back

I went to the bar to go buy her a drink

She listen to P!nk, she told me she not a rapper

I can't run out of money

The trenches love me forever

They treat me like Ed in London

Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'

Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar

She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars



Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out

They don't love you and they only love you right now

If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

And leave them Broadway girls alone

Broadway girls, Broadway girls

Them Broadway girls alone

Broadway girls, Broadway girls

Them Broadway girls alone



Oh, think I oughta settle down

And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh

But I told 'em that I'm savage

They just tryna tell me there's



There's two things that you're gonna find out

They don't love you and they only love you right now

Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar

Found the solution and got some more problems

We from the sandbox, my dog since a toddler

16 year old when I shed my first chopper

Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa Locka

Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (Fly helicopters)

I count every blessin' and count every dollar

I'm 'bout to go factory plain

I treat all of my dogs the same

Take care all of my bitches the same

I just hope you financially sane

Never turning my back on the gang

From the A, we was taught to be brave

Had to squabble and take a few fades

Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase

Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered

I got style, I don't know what you heard of

You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile

You want someone you can show off

Whenever you go out

To wear a tight mini black dress

With all her friends around

And then you'll probably spend the night at

Her nice big house

And by then I'll just be standing

You've forgotten about, oh

Circles Around This Town,Maren Morris,2022,human,"I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment

First month's, last month's, two deposits

Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet

Thank God I was an optimist



I drove circles around this town

Trying to write circles around this town

Trying to say something with meaning, something worth singing about

I've been kind and I've been ruthless

Yeah, I got here but the truth is

Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different

But I still got the pedal down

Driving circles around this town



So many times I thought about leaving

Got my ass kicked trying to compete with

Everybody else's ones that got away

Hung around long enough to catch a break



Couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked

Was the one about a car and the one about a church

That I wrote



Driving circles around this town

Trying to write circles around this town

Trying to say something with meaning, something worth singing about

I've been kind and I've been ruthless

Yeah, I got here but the truth is

Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
